# GTK32FA
## 2 Factor Authentication Wallet
---
This is very WIP.

It is also very bad.

Ext module dependencies:
- pygobject
- xdg
- pyotp
- pyyaml


---

Note: storage.yaml must be manually constructed rn. no encryption. application WILL NOT save changes. example yaml is included

Note: script will make its directories in XDG_DATA_HOME/GTK32FA and XDG_CONFIG_HOME/GTK32FA. Looks for storage at XDG_DATA_HOME/GTK32FA/storage.yaml
