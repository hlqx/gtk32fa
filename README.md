This is very WIP.

It is also very bad.

Ext module dependencies:
- pygobject
- xdg
- pyotp
- pyyaml
- cryptography

!!: Encryption does not work yet. Application functions as intended if you opt not to use it. To reset any changes, remove config.yaml in XDG_CONFIG_HOME/GTK32FA.

!!: Can't remove codes yet.
