## Two Factor Authentication Wallet

- A two factor authentication program for Linux.
- Early development
- Works with GNOME.
- Hasn't been properly tested with anything else.
- Very scuffed.
- Supports TOTP and HOTP codes.
- Stores codes in the system keyring.
- Works well on the Librem 5 QEMU image last I checked.
- Mostly a learning experience.
